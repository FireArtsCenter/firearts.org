    <p>The Chicago Artists Resource presents a number of great articles which attack the issues with which artists grapple like finding studio space and that crazy little thing called inspiration. Real life stories from artists make this a great way to clear your head after a rough day of distributing slides...you really are not alone.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://www.chicagohotglass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Hot Glass</a></h2>
    <p>Chicago Hot Glass is another great place to warm up in the city. We at the <em>Fire Arts Center of Chicago</em> sure love our fire, but thanks to these guys, we are not alone in that respect. This group of fire-lovers share their glass-blowing craft with all those interested. They feature some great classes and events like the <em>Third Monday Jazz Nights</em> which incorporates some great jazz alongside glass blowing demos.</p>
