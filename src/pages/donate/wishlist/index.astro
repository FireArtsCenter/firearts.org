				What do you get a community arts education center that has it all? Well
				we here at the Fire Arts Center of Chicago will let you know when we do
				get it all. In the meantime, please check out what we <em>don’t</em> have.

				Below is a list of items that we are trying to obtain for the studio. We
				are constantly striving to offer more options for our students and
				members, but to do so we often need essential equipment. We will be
				creating a list of items that the studio needs. If you have any leads on
				any of this equipment please <Link href='/contact-us/'>contact us</Link
				>. We, of course, prefer donations, but if you know of any discount
				equipment that might be helpful, let us know.
