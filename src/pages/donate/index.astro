		<p>
			So you want to help out the Fire Arts Center of Chicago. There are a
			number of ways you can help:
		</p>

		<div class='note'>
			<h2>Take a class</h2>
			<p>
				That’s right. Just sign up for a class. We here at Fire Arts are excited
				about sharing our knowledge with the community. We love having the
				studio full of excited people making art. And on top of it, the money
				you give for classes goes to the promotion of more classes! So <Link
					href='/membership/'>sign up today</Link
				>
				.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class='note'>
			<h2>Give ’til it hurts</h2>
			<p>
				So you are not interested in taking a class at this time, but want to
				ensure that others in the community are able to experience the joys of
				the fire arts. We all appreciate the offer.{' '}
				<Link href='/contact-us/'>Contact us</Link> about donating money. You can
				stop by the studio or mail in a check if you like.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class='note'>
			<h2>And then give some more</h2>
			<p>
				Don’t really have much money to give out. Not to worry, we also accept
				supplies and equipment donations. We like to consider ourselves a
				recycling center of sorts. <Link href='/contact-us/'>Contact us</Link> about
				what types of material we can use. You’d be surprised, so why not call and
				find out. Businesses with any sort of equipment (metal fabrication tools,
				power saws, welding equipment, hand tools, cement mixers, buckets, and so
				much more) be sure to <Link href='/contact-us/'>contact us</Link> as well.
				Hate the idea of having to haul that giant drill press to the scrap heap...contact
				us and we may be able to come pick it up for you. We’re glad to help out.
				Be sure to check our <Link href='/donate/wishlist/'>wish list</Link> for lists
				of specific equipment that we are hoping to obtain.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class='note'>
			<h2>Tell a friend</h2>
			<p>
				Know someone who might like to get involved at the Fire Arts Center of
				Chicago. Pass the word along to them. Better yet, why not surprise them
				with the gift of fire...
				<Link href='/membership/'>sign them up for classes today</Link>. They
				may even thank you by making you a full suit of armor, a sculpture of
				you cast in bronze, or maybe that steel-frame desk you have been hoping
				to get but couldn’t afford to buy at the store. Now that is a gift!
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			As you can see there are so many ways to help us pour another bronze
			sculpture, weld another piece of furniture, forge another suit of armor,
			or sculpt another figure in clay. But again, our favorite way to keep the
			place running is to...well...keep it running.{' '}
			<Link href='/membership/'> Sign up for classes </Link>{' '}
			and help us do just that. We look forward to having you in our next <Link
				href='/classes/'>class</Link
			>.
