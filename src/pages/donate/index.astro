				The best way to support us is to sign up for a class. We are excited to
				share our knowledge with the community and love having the studio full
				of creative people making art.
			</Text>
			<Text>
				The money you pay for classes goes directly to support more classes! So <Link
					href='/contact-us/'>contact the {org.name} today to sign up</Link
				>
				.

			<Text as='h2'>Donate money</Text>
			<Text>
				Do you know someone that would like to take a class or maybe just want
				to give a gift to support our programming in general? Ensure that others
				in the community are able to experience the joys of the fire arts by
				donating money.

				We are always looking for supplies and equipment donations, too. <Link
					href='/contact-us/'
					>Contact us to find out the types of material we can use</Link
				>. Businesses with equipment to donate (e.g. metal fabrication tools,
				power saws, welding equipment, hand tools, cement mixers, buckets,
				etc.), <Link href='/contact-us/'>contact us</Link>.

				We are working on a <Link href='/donate/wishlist/'

			<Text as='h2'>Spread the word</Text>
			<Text>
				Do you know someone who might be interested in the {org.name}. Pass the
				word along to them, or&mdash;better yet&mdash;surprise them with the
				gift of fire in the form of a class...
				<Link href='/contact-us/'
					>Contact us to get them signed up for a class today</Link
				>. They may even thank you by making you a full suit of armor, a
				sculpture of you cast in bronze, or maybe that steel-frame desk you have
				been hoping to get but couldn’t afford.

		<Text>
			There are many ways to help us pour another bronze sculpture, weld another
			piece of furniture, forge another suit of armor, or sculpt another figure
			in clay. But our favorite way to keep the place running is to fill up the
			classroom. <Link href='/contact-us/'>
				Contact us to sign up for a class</Link
			> to help us do that.
