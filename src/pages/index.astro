				We at the {org.name} are not immune to the challenges of a difficult economy.
				Our mission has always been to preserve the traditional methods and techniques
				of sculptors as well as the technical skills relevant to those just looking
				to develop a new trade. In order for us to meet that mission we need to provide
				our classes to as many people as we can. However, when times are tough, finding
				the money to pay for classes like this is hard. For that reason we have been
				offering a 1/2-down payment plan to make it easier to pay for classes. Now,
				in addition to that discount, we are introducing a bartered services option
				to reduce class prices.

			<Text>
				Do you have experience with fund-raising and think you can lend a hand?
				Maybe accounting or legal experience? Do you work somewhere that tosses
				out scrap metal which could be reused by us? The possibilties are
				endless. The {org.name} is always looking for tips and materials to help us
				grow, and we want to offer you ways to learn for less.

				Call us at 773.544.9908. It’s as simple as that. Call and let us know
				what you have to trade and we can work out a discount plan for you.
