    <h2><a href="http://www.truerustic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">True Rustic</a></h2>
    <p>True Rustic is the website of Madeline True, an artist whose experiences living on small islands in the Caribbean, the South Pacific and the San Juan Islands for the past 15 years, have developed a philosophical depth that is evident in each of her creations. Throughout her travels, she has also gained a rich knowledge of materials from metal to wood and ceramic to photography.</p>
